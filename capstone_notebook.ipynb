            "source": "# Data Science Capstone Introduction\nMy project is going to try to answer the question of where someone should open a comic book store in my area.  My audience is largely myself, since I am considering if I should try to start a business or not, but would apply to anyone potentially interested in opening a comic store.  I spent most of my life living in the Midwest (United States) and most of the comic stores I knew there were largely dependent on foot traffic: people literally walking past the store and deciding to drop in and see what was there.  A few years ago, though, I moved to southern New Jersey where there aren't many places with foot traffic.  Most stores are in little shopping centers that are unconnected from each other, and you have to drive most places anyway as the area is not very walkable or public transit-friendly.  So there are really two questions to answer: is this a good place to open a comic store at all? And if so, where would you want to place it?"

            "source": "### Find Similar Cities\nThere are many ways to determine how cities might be similar to each other.  There's population, area, demographics, income levels, and much more.  I decided to rely on other people already having done the work.  I found two references:\n\n[This](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/03/upshot/what-is-your-citys-twin.html) New York Times article written by someone who works at Indeed.  You can look up a city (as long as it's sufficiently large to be in their list) and it will tell you what other cities are similar to it in terms of job listings.  I thought this would be helpful because job listings could be related to income and certain kinds of people who like to buy comics.\n\n[This](https://www.chicagofed.org/region/community-development/data/pcit) tool put together by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, which lets you enter a city and it tells you what other cities are similar to it on a few different dimensions: equity (demographics and income inequality measures), resilience (unemployment, income levels, and labor force participation measures), outlook (population and demographics measures), and housing (home value and rent measures).  I thought this would be helpful as more direct measures of what the different cities are like but put together by a different group, and thus resulting in different similar cities.\n\nOne limitation of these tool is that my exactly city, Egg Harbor Township NJ, is not big enough to be in their databases.  So I will use Atlantic City NJ as the 'base' city to compare to.  Another option would be Philadelphia, which is the nearest large city, but I am not interested in looking at Philadelphia.  I want to look at options in southern New Jersey specifically.\n\nUsing Atlantic City as the base city, I could use over 20 comparison cities based on these two references.  That seems like too many, especially since some of the comparisons won't really be very similar to Atlantic City, so I am going to choose the following:\n\n* Las Vegas, NV from the Times link: Atlantic City is a gambling-based tourist town, so Vegas makes a lot of sense.  Vegas is a much bigger city and better tourist draw, though.\n* North Port, FL from the Times link: seven of the top ten matches are in Florida.  North Port is 4th of the 7, but the similarity scores are very similar and North Port has the smallest population, making it a bit more similar to Atlantic City.  Both are coastal towns.\n* Cleveland and Dayton, OH: the top matches from the Chicago equity link.  They're also on the resilience list.\n* Albany, GA; the top match from the Chicago resilience link.\n* Port Arthur, TX: the top match from the Chicago outlook link.\n* New Orleans, LA: not the top match in the Chicago housing link, but fairly similar.  New Orleans was also on the Times list, presumably because both cities are heavily based on tourism.\n\nThese seven cities will hopefully give me a good sense of if they can support comic book stores, and thus if southern New Jersey should be able to, while also representing a range of city types.  I won't be dependent on comparing my area to one other place and relying on its special characteristics or uniqueness."

            "source": "### Analyze The Similar Cities\nI will use the Foursquare API to look at these cities in two steps:\n1. How many comic stores are there in the area?\n2. What kinds of places (Foursquare venues) are near those stores?\n3. What kinds of places are **not** near stores?\n\nSpecifically, since the cities cover a range of sizes, I will use the lat/long and area listed for each city on Wikipedia to define an appropriate center and range for a Foursquare venue 'search' for comics.  I'll have to do some filtering on the results, as I know from doing a Foursquare search of my area that there could be redundant entries (I get my local comic store as well as the mall where it is located, and another business is listed twice under different categories).\n\nOnce I have a list of comic stores in each of the comparison cities, I will do a Foursquare venue 'explore' around each store for what other points of interest are nearby.  Are comic stores near restaurants and coffee shops?  Are they in malls or other retail shopping?  Are there any that are near parks or something else?  This will be similar to what we did for the week 3 assignment, but based around comic stores instead of neighborhoods.  Importantly, I will pick a few lat/longs not near comic stores and get their characteristics as well.  This is a neccesary step to make sure I'm not just picking retail areas or something where any kind of store could be; I want to find what makes a good place for a comic store specifically."

            "source": "### Compare to My Area\nFinally, I will take the venue types from the comic stores in other cities and see if there's a similar area near me.  I will answer this question in a couple ways:\n1. How many comic stores are there in the other cities, and how does that number relate to characteristics in the Chicago link?  For example, there could be a simple relationship where larger cities have more stores, but perhaps it also varies with income level.\n2. How does my area fit into a clustering analysis of those areas?  I'll do a similar analysis to our week 3 assignment, adding my area to the comparison cities, and see which cluster my area fits into if any.\n3. A discrimination/logistic regression - type analysis to distinguish between areas that have comic stores and those that don't, to better see where in my area would be a good choice.\n\nAt the end of this analysis, I should have an idea of how many comic stores an area might support (since mine already has two) and what kinds of areas they tend to be in as defined by Foursquare venues."
