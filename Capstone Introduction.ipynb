My audience is largely myself, since I am considering if I should try to start a business or not, but would apply to anyone potentially interested in opening a comic store.  I spent most of my life living in the Midwest (United States) and most of the comic stores I knew there were largely dependent on foot traffic: people literally walking past the store and deciding to drop in and see what was there.  A few years ago, though, I moved to southern New Jersey where there aren't many places with foot traffic.  Most stores are in little shopping centers that are unconnected from each other, and you have to drive most places anyway as the area is not very walkable or public transit-friendly.  So there are really two questions to answer: is this a good place to open a comic store at all? "
