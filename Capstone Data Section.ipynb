            "source": "### Find Similar Cities\nThere are many ways to determine how cities might be similar to each other.  There's population, area, demographics, income levels, and much more.  I decided to rely on other people already having done the work.  I found two references:\n\n[This](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/03/upshot/what-is-your-citys-twin.html) New York Times article written by someone who works at Indeed.  You can look up a city (as long as it's sufficiently large to be in their list) and it will tell you what other cities are similar to it in terms of job listings.  I thought this would be helpful because job listings could be related to income and certain kinds of people who like to buy comics.\n\n[This](https://www.chicagofed.org/region/community-development/data/pcit) tool put together by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, which lets you enter a city and it tells you what other cities are similar to it on a few different dimensions: equity (demographics and income inequality measures), resilience (unemployment, income levels, and labor force participation measures), outlook (population and demographics measures), and housing (home value and rent measures).  I thought this would be helpful as more direct measures of what the different cities are like but put together by a different group, and thus resulting in different similar cities.\n\nOne limitation of these tool is that my exactly city, Egg Harbor Township NJ, is not big enough to be in their databases.  So I will use Atlantic City NJ as the 'base' city to compare to.  Another option would be Philadelphia, which is the nearest large city, but I am not interested in looking at Philadelphia.  I want to look at options in southern New Jersey specifically.\n\nUsing Atlantic City as the base city, I could use over 20 comparison cities based on these two references.  That seems like too many, especially since some of the comparisons won't really be very similar to Atlantic City, so I am going to choose the following:\n\n* Las Vegas, NV from the Times link: Atlantic City is a gambling-based tourist town, so Vegas makes a lot of sense.  Vegas is a much bigger city and better tourist draw, though.\n* North Port, FL from the Times link: seven of the top ten matches are in Florida.  North Port is 4th of the 7, but the similarity scores are very similar and North Port has the smallest population, making it a bit more similar to Atlantic City.  Both are coastal towns.\n* Cleveland and Dayton, OH: the top matches from the Chicago equity link.  They're also on the resilience list.\n* Albany, GA; the top match from the Chicago resilience link.\n* Port Arthur, TX: the top match from the Chicago outlook link.\n* New Orleans, LA: not the top match in the Chicago housing link, but fairly similar.  New Orleans was also on the Times list, presumably because both cities are heavily based on tourism.\n\nThese seven cities will hopefully give me a good sense of if they can support comic book stores, and thus if southern New Jersey should be able to, while also representing a range of city types.  I won't be dependent on comparing my area to one other place and relying on its special characteristics or uniqueness.\n"
